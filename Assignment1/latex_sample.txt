The US-Government has announced a new policy to make the reaserch publicly available. To summarize,
the policy's main goal is to give tax-payers the right to have access to the reaserch which they have
funded without having any need to go through any pay-walls to see the results of the research without any delay. The Biden
administration is aiming to weaken the publishers ability to excersise full control over the pubished 
papers and keep it from making it available through pay-walls. The policy change 
is going to have a global impact if it is implemented. The commercial publication sector is going to 
take a hit as editing and production costs are difficult to obtain if the policy is implemented. There 
are open-access business models proprsed by publishers, like the PLOS journal, that are collecting fee 
from the authors to make their work availble for the public. Such journals are also aginst this policy.
Many publishers have criticized the policy but are in support of the idea to make the the publications
available to the public, while some feel that a meaningful consultation of the publishers
opinion should have been taken into consideration while drafting the policy.

From my perspective, I belive that the policy should be accepted. For groups and underpriviledged
and developing nations, this policy would help the scientific community in these regions of the world to have
the access to the information. This can have major impact over various domains of health, food, commerce
, technology, etc. Universities being one of the major contributors of research will be able to 
contribute to the community as this open-access will help direct the cost of journal subscription
towards actual research. The inferences of the research will prove imperative in bringing out awareness
pertaining to a spesific domain if it is released publicly which will attract more research in the 
domains like medical science.
